To create a modern GUI application in C# for managing folders, documents, and interactions with an SQLite database, follow this outline. The application will leverage Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for its modern interface capabilities. This outline covers the setup of the project, the main features, and the structure of the user interface.

### Project Setup

1. **Create a WPF Project in Visual Studio:**
   - Select the WPF App (.NET Core) template to create a new project.
   - Name the project appropriately (e.g., `EscrowDocumentManager`).

2. **Add Necessary NuGet Packages:**
   - System.Data.SQLite: For SQLite database interaction.
   - MaterialDesignThemes: For a modern UI look and feel.

3. **Set Up the SQLite Database:**
   - Use the provided SQL commands in the `DatabaseInitialization` class to create your database and initial tables.

### Application Structure

1. **MainWindow.xaml:**
   - Design the main window with a modern Material Design look.
   - Implement a navigation menu with items such as Home/Dashboard, Properties, Documents, Escrows, etc.
   - Use a Frame or ContentControl to switch between different views/pages within the application.

2. **ViewModels:**
   - Create a BaseViewModel for common properties and INotifyPropertyChanged implementation.
   - Implement specific ViewModels for each page (e.g., `DashboardViewModel`, `PropertiesViewModel`, `DocumentsViewModel`).

3. **Models:**
   - Define models corresponding to database tables (e.g., `Document`, `Escrow`, `Party`, `Transaction`).
   - Include properties that match the columns in each database table.

4. **Data Access Layer (DAL):**
   - Implement a class for database operations (e.g., `DatabaseService`).
   - Use Dapper or Entity Framework Core for easier data manipulation and querying.

5. **Pages:**
   - Create a WPF Page (XAML) for each section of the application, such as Dashboard, Properties, Documents, Escrows, etc.
   - Design each page to display and manage its respective data in a user-friendly manner.

### Main Features Implementation

1. **Dashboard:**
   - Display summary statistics, recent documents, and open escrows.
   - Implement widgets or cards for a quick overview.

2. **Document Management:**
   - Allow users to add, edit, and delete documents.
   - Implement a file picker for attaching document files.
   - Integrate with the `Documents` table in the SQLite database.

3. **Properties Management:**
   - Enable listing, adding, editing, and deleting property records.
   - Provide a form for inputting property details.

4. **Escrow Management:**
   - Facilitate creating and tracking escrow processes.
   - Link escrows with properties, parties, and documents.

5. **Searching and Filtering:**
   - Implement search and filter capabilities for documents, properties, and escrows.

6. **Integrations:**
   - (Future Scope) Consider integrating with Microsoft Word for document editing, Microsoft Outlook for email communication, and DocuSign for electronic signatures.

### User Interface Design

- Utilize Material Design principles to ensure a modern and intuitive user interface.
- Implement a responsive layout that adapts to different window sizes.
- Use animations and transitions for a smooth user experience.

### Additional Considerations

- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
- **Security:** Ensure sensitive data is handled securely, especially when dealing with personal information.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for the business logic to ensure reliability.

This outline provides a roadmap for developing a modern GUI application for escrow document management. It encompasses the project setup, application structure, main features, and design considerations, paving the way for a comprehensive solution.
