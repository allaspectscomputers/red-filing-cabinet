Creating a Microsoft Word add-on (also known as a Word Add-in) in C# involves several steps, including setting up a Visual Studio project with Office development tools, and then implementing the logic to interact with the SQLite database for escrow document management. Below is a simplified skeleton that demonstrates the structure and key components you would need to develop such an add-on.

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio with Office Development Tools installed.
- A reference to the `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word` assembly to interact with Microsoft Word.
- A reference to `System.Data.SQLite` for SQLite database interaction.

### Steps to Create the Add-on

1. **Create a Word Add-In Project**: In Visual Studio, create a new project and select the template for a Word Add-In. This template provides a basic framework for Word Add-In development.

2. **Add References**: Ensure that your project has references to `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word` and `System.Data.SQLite`. These references are crucial for interacting with Word and SQLite respectively.

3. **Implement the Add-In Logic**: The core functionality will include connecting to the SQLite database, fetching documents, and integrating with Word.

### Example Skeleton Code

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SQLite;
using Microsoft.Office.Tools.Ribbon;
using Word = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word;

public partial class ThisAddIn
{
    private void ThisAddIn_Startup(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
    {
        // Initialize your add-on here
    }

    private void ThisAddIn_Shutdown(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
    {
        // Clean up any resources or connections
    }

    // Example function to open a document by ID
    public void OpenDocument(int documentId)
    {
        string connectionString = "Data Source=path_to_your_escrow_database.sqlite;Version=3;";
        using (var connection = new SQLiteConnection(connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            string query = "SELECT DocumentPath FROM Documents WHERE DocumentID = @DocumentId";
            using (var command = new SQLiteCommand(query, connection))
            {
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@DocumentId", documentId);
                var path = command.ExecuteScalar()?.ToString();
                
                if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(path))
                {
                    // Open document with Word
                    Word.Application wordApp = this.Application;
                    wordApp.Documents.Open(path);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Add more methods as needed for document interaction
}

// Ribbon (if needed) to add buttons or other controls for user interaction
public partial class MyRibbon : RibbonBase
{
    // Implement Ribbon with buttons for different actions (e.g., OpenDocument)
    // Button click events can call methods in ThisAddIn class
}
```

### Notes

- **Database Path**: Replace `"path_to_your_escrow_database.sqlite"` with the actual path to your SQLite database.
- **Document Path Storage**: This example assumes that the `Documents` table in your SQLite database has a column `DocumentPath` that stores the file path of the document. Adjust the query according to your actual database schema.
- **Ribbon UI**: If you want to add a custom ribbon with buttons for interacting with the documents (e.g., a button to open a document), you will need to design the ribbon and implement its event handlers to invoke methods like `OpenDocument`.

### Final Steps

After implementing the add-in logic and UI interactions as needed, test the add-in with Word to ensure it functions as expected. For a production environment, you may need to handle additional considerations such as error handling, security, and deployment.
